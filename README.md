This is a tutorial I followed from "freeCodeCamp.org" that teaches how to create a web database app in ASP.NET Core using Visual Studio and the C# language.

The tutorial showed me how to:
- Use the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
- Configure database tables using the Entity framework.
- Setup of classes as models. Customize Razor forms.
- Create methods inside a controller.
- Style an ASP.NET page with CSS.
- Use Bootstrap classes.
- Create a search function to filter database results.
